Contains simulation and estimation Jupyter notebooks.
This folder hosts the Jupyter notebooks used throughout the project. The files
are numbered to reflect the suggested execution order.

1. `01-macro-model-structure.ipynb`
2. `02-psi-output-loss-simulation.ipynb`
3. `03-psi-dynamic-path.ipynb`
4. `04-lfp-welfare-simulation.ipynb`
5. `05-policy-simulation-scenarios.ipynb`

Each notebook assumes the conda environment defined in the repository root and
expects the sample data in `../data/sample_lfp.csv`.
