# The Hidden Friction: ψ as a Behavioural Macroeconomic Distortion

This repository introduces `ψ`, a norm-induced wage suppression parameter representing post-marital labor market frictions unrelated to fertility. We embed ψ into a dynamic Overlapping Generations (OLG) macroeconomic model to simulate growth, welfare, and fiscal implications.

## Core Contributions
- Definition and empirical estimation of ψ across countries.
- Structural integration of ψ into general equilibrium simulations.
- Simulation of GDP losses, labor force participation shifts, and fiscal drag.
- Foundational framing of "behavioural macrofrictions".

## Repository Structure
- `/code/`: Jupyter notebooks for empirical and simulation logic.
- `/data/`: Placeholder for SHP, SOEP, WVS, etc. (access instructions only).
- `/docs/`: Theoretical notes on embedding ψ into macroeconomic systems.
